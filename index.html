            <h3><span class="accent"><i class="bi bi-person-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is <b>Éinín</b> (<b>yes,</b> it's Irish; it means "little bird.") I'm a <b>23 year old</b> <em>aspiring</em> front-end web developer who already knows <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> and is in the process of learning <b>Javascript</b> (among other things.) My "thing" is that I like to design websites for things that do not exist (<a href="#projects">see below</a>.)</p>  

                <p>I started doing "basic web design" as a kid/young teen on <a href="https://neopets.com/">Neopets</a> and started "taking it seriously" last year. I've been getting up to date on my best practices (which were roughly 15 years out of date...) and working on making my code cleaner and more legible, as well as simply refining my skills into something workable on the modern internet.</p>
                
                <p>I'm also learning about coding best practices in general-- learning to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> efficiently (instead of typing everything line by line into the native Notepad app on Windows, yikes!) and practicing working with other useful tools such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.</p>

                <p>My main goal is to prioritize <b>accessibility</b> and <b>user experience</b> in my designs, including <i>mobile-friendly accessibility</i> as I've recently learnt how many people view websites on their phones first and foremost.</p>

        <section id="skills">
            <h3><span class="accent"><i class="bi bi-file-earmark-person-fill" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> Skills</h3>
                <p>Right now the only skill that I am entirely confident in my abilities in is <b>HTML/CSS</b>. I have been doing it for a very, very long time (I started before I was 10, so I have a decade of experience!) and I consider myself <em>very</em> good at it. I would describe myself as "extremely proficient."</p>

                <p>Some other web skills I have include using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build webpages. I learnt it in the span of a few hours to build custom character profiles on a website called <a href="https://toyhou.se/">toyhou.se</a> for my best friend (who is also my brother.) I have built multiple standalone webpages using Bootstrap since, using some custom colors and elements as well as some with overrides in an external stylesheet.</p>
                
                <p>You can view <a href="https://moiraodeorain.com/roleplay/oasisministries">the first webpage I built with Bootstrap here</a>, which uses some custom styles but is <em>mostly</em> raw Bootstrap. It is a webpage for a fictional organization from the video game <i>Overwatch</i>. The <a href="https://moiraodeorain.com/roleplay/overwatch">second page I built in Bootstrap</a> is similar. I chose to use Bootstrap in order to simulate the design of a corporate website, which I believe comes across more efficiently in the design first example but is more accurate in the second.</p>
                    
                <p>I am also learning to use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, which can go hand in hand with developing with Bootstrap; it's been a challenge to learn how to set up my development environment for more complicated projects, but I'm getting there. While I haven't yet had a project large enough to mentally justify using both Bootstrap and Sass at once, I <em>highly</em> suspect these skills will come into use in the near future, given my plans...!</p>

                <p>I am learning to use <b>Javascript</b>. I am not good at it yet-- programming is something I've been struggling to get into for a long time. It's a difficult process, and a bit slow for me (which is crazy! I'm not used to having trouble picking things up!) but I think I'm making decent progress and I'm proud of my work.</p>

                    <p>This is my personal website that's <em>not</em> on Github Pages. It's a bit of a longer introduction about me, more personal and less about my coding, and contains links to some of the other stuff I've worked on (though most of it is listed below.) It's for having a cool personal website, because making one of those nifty card things on <a href="https://carrd.co/">carrd</a> was genuinely too hard for me.</p>

                    <p>My beloved pet project! My website for my favorite <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a> character, <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes/moira/">Dr. Moira O'Deorain</a> (all links lead to the official Blizzard website.) She's a geneticist (so cool!) who is also a member of an evil organization called Talon (cool for different reasons.) I've been making fake webpages for her for a couple of years because my other hobby is collaborative fiction and I wanted a list of my headcanons laid out in one convenient place (like a show bible!) and I hated using Google Docs.</p>

                    <a href="https://roleplayer.info/" class="project">roleplayer.info</a>
                    <p>Roleplayer.info is a project I'm working on to help roleplayers around the internet. Roleplaying is one of my favorite online hobbies and I was always looking for new places to find partners but constantly found myself wishing there were more information about the individual cultures and nuances of each website or app... so I'm doing it myself! Roleplayer.info is a website dedicated to helping people find places to roleplay online <em>as well as</em> teach them what to expect and how to best use them! I'm hoping to do cultural writeups on each in order to make it easier for new members to utilize them as effectively as possible.</p>
